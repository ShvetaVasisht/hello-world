# Respectful Code Reviews

**TL;DR**
The basis for a fruitful and positive collaboration is respectful and constructive feedback.


## Why You Might Want

While code review is recognized as a valuable tool for improving the quality of software projects, code review comments that are perceived as being unclear or harsh can have unfavorable consequences

The right style of communication not only helps to build relationships and healthy work environments but also helps to achieve the final goal of delivering a quality product. It improves the overall health of the system and code



## Problems X Helps to Solve

-   **Biased solutions People are often**  biased towards their own solutions The reviewer may suggest new ways of solving a particular problem while reading through the code or asking questions. A constructive and positive feedback encourages a person to be more receptive towards feedback
-   **Unhealthy work environment**  A positive feedback attracts better attention and allows others to look at suggestions in accepting manner be respectful towards other peopleâ€™s views
-   **Knowledge Stagnation**   Code reviews are also a great means of project- and company-specific knowledge exchange. Respectful code reviews encourage open discussions between the reviewer and developer and help in knowledge sharing.
- **Time wastage**  A lot of time is saved when the reviewer and developer share a common goal of delivering a quality product and work together for it.
-   **Poor code quality** No developer is perfect, but everyone is different and has a unique perspective. Code reviews enable us to discover possible bugs or architectural flaws early on, before even manually testing and delivering the app.
